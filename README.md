# FRTN70 - Project in Systems, Control and Learning!

This is a project in course FRTN70 at LTH, 2021.


Project is conducted by `Cem Alpt√ºrk` and `Pukashawar Pannu`.  
Project supervisor `Emil Vladu`.

## Goal - Balance Inverted Double Pendulum on Cart
The goal of the project is to teach a controller to balance an inverted double pendulum on a cart using reinforcement learning.
This is chaotic problem and the controller is limited to a single degree of freedom for balancing the pendulums.

## Get Started
Project has been developed using `Python 3`.
Dependencies can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
# Tensorflow 2.0 requires a pip version > 19.0
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -r src/requirements.txt
```

## TODO - Short description about reinforcement learning?

### Code Structure
The code has been separated in modules to simplify separation of logic.
`Environment` module contains everything related to the dynamic problem with the pendulum equations and a class structure that pans a way to apply an action to the system from the outside and also a way to receive a reward from the executed action.

Code in the `Agents` module contain the algorithms for training a controller using reinforcement learning.l
There are (TODO: Will be hopefully) a couple of different algorithms for training.
The idea is that a trained algorithm produces a finished controller that can be applied and used directly on the dynamic system.

```python
# TODO: Add a short example for how to use an agent
```

Code for training a controller for the double pendulum on a cart problem is found in `src/`.
With all dependencies installed it should be enough to run the `src/Training_Double_Pendulum.py` script.
The script produces training statistics and a trained controller that can be used to simulate a new pendulum scenario with the controller.
